This is Bob. 
     Bob The Robot is made up of plastic cups and other ordinary household items. Bob stays alert and watches your back as you program or are surfing the internet on your computer. If he hears a loud thump or disturbance,  he will activate his "defense mode" and alert you by flashing his built-in LED's. Bob is fairly power hungry, so after 4-6 minutes (he randomly chooses) when to fall asleep until woken up by electric shock (at user's decision). He is a good companion overall, your deepest and darkest secrets are safe with him. Bob is a good friend and is tolerant, be like Bob.
